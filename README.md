          Online FurnitureShopping Using Augmented Reality
 
 
 In this fastest moving world, preserving time is one of the tiring process in day to day
 life. We depend on online shopping sites in order to preserve the time which might be
 wasted while going directly to the shops. Using this Furniture App we tries to implement
 a fully online shopping site based on Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality gets our
 attention mostly due to its “cool factor.” Now it’s becoming more of a reality, and forward
thinking retail brands are incorporating Augmented Reality technology into the customer
 experience. The Application is meant for a single furniture shop who can manage furniture.
 And also this application provides customers with a better shopping experience so that
 he/she can choose the most suitable furniture for their home without even going to the
 shops but simply by checking it using their smart phones with the help of augmented reality.
 Furniture App is a completely an online application so that all transactions could be done
 under user-convenience. The existing furniture shopping system is very full of effort the
 customers have to go to the market and then check different shops in order to buy what they
 want. Sometimes they have to try even ten shops and yet unable to buy the same furniture of
 the required design or color suited with their house.The Existing online furniture shopping
 allow the users to see only the different images of the product and these data is useless to
 select a furniture. Research has found that many of the customers choose furniture in a
 hasty fashion and it cause buying the wrong sized item for their room# Main_Project
